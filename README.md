## Overview of Problem

Customer churn is a major problem and one of the most important concerns for
large companies. Due to the direct effect on the revenues of the companies,
especially in the telecom field, companies are seeking to develop means to
predict potential customer churn. Therefore, finding factors that increase
customer churn is important to take necessary actions to reduce this churn.

**GOAL:** Develop a churn prediction model that assists telecom operators in
predicting customers who are most likely subject to churn.
